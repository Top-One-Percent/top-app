## Developer
This is a solo project, at least for now, made by me: @alejopadido

## Why I did it?
It's something I'd really like to use on a daily basis to track my progress and improve a 1% everyday. 

I also think that it'd be of utility to a lot of people out there.

Last and not least, because I'm currently a 18-year-old Junior Software Developer with Flutter, I see this project as an oportunity to practice, learn and improve my abilities.
